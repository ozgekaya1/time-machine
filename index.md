<header style=text-align:center;">
<p style="color:OldLace;font-size:25px;text-align:center;"><b><u>The Master and Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov </u><i>(Мастер и Маргарита)</i></b></p>

<p style="color: Brown;font-size:20px;background-color:OldLace">Depiction of Human Nature, Good, and Evil</p>
<p style="color: Black; background-color:Wheat">Woland, the Devil in the book is an ambiguous character; he is like a human character. When it comes to his deeds, there is no clear distinction between good and bad. Here, the Devil is a meticulous observer of humanity, of contemporary Moscow and of ancient Jerusalem. Woland concludes that people of Moscow living in the 1930s and people of Jerusalem living in the times of Yeshua (Jesus) have the same qualities – the essence of human nature does not change even if the structure of the state changes – it is still impossible to transform a “human soul”. Times change, discoveries happen but human nature remains the same, no matter what political system or religion is in place.</p>
<p>
<p style="color: Black;background-color:Wheat">During Black Magic Debut Carnival in contemporary Moscow, there was a double queue, when one of Woland’s assistants rained down money on people. According to the ideology of the Soviet Union, people were supposed to be unconcerned with a personal gain, but the reality was often opposite as shown in the book.</p>

<p style="color: Brown;font-size:20px;background-color:OldLace">Creative and Religious Freedom | the Importance of Words, Stories as the Foundation of the Civilisationv</p>

<p style="color: Black;background-color:Wheat">These famous words from The Master and Margarita: “Manuscripts do not burn” serve as a reminder of the power of stories over the oppression and terror. Words can transcend many spheres – can impact the course of history.  Writing is the expression of freedom which is the foundation of civilisation.</p>

<p style="color: Brown;font-size:20px;background-color:OldLace">Moral Dilemmas under Totalitarian Regime</p>
<p style="color: Black;background-color:Wheat">The Master and Margarita portrays a number of moral dilemmas faced by people living under the regime.
The examples of these dilemmas are: Margarita going into pact with evil to save the Master; Margarita choosing compassion for Frieda over her love for the Master; again Margarita was married at the time when she met the Master but her husband was a part of the state (there is a mention that her husband was responsible for killing another person); and the Master did not stand up for his beliefs.
Bulgakov points out to the tragedy of human existence where good and evil often coexist and the choice between two is not always an easy one and often it is an impossible choice.</p>

<p style="color: Brown;font-size:20px;">Here is a quote from The Master and Margarita:</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/876183">
But would you kindly ponder this question: What would your good do if
evil didn't exist, and what would the earth look like if all the shadows
disappeared? After all, shadows are cast by things and people. Here is the
shadow of my sword. But shadows also come from trees and living beings.
Do you want to strip the earth of all trees and living things just because
of your fantasy of enjoying naked light? You're stupid.
